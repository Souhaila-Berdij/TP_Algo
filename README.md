## Souhaila BERDIJ et Estelle CHARRET

This project includes solutions to various algorithmic problems implemented in C++. Each exercise applies specific data structures and algorithms, including dynamic programming, Kruskal’s algorithm for graphs, and subsequence calculations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized around five exercises, each designed to solve a particular problem. Solutions are implemented as standalone functions, invoked in the main.cpp file. Here’s an overview of the available exercises:

## Exercise 1: Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)
Description: Finds the longest increasing subsequence in a given sequence of integers.
Input: INPMONOSEQ.TXT containing the sequence size and elements.
Output: OUTMONOSEQ.TXT with the length of the subsequence and the indices of the elements in the original sequence.
Algorithm: Dynamic programming.

## Exercise 2: Longest Subsequence Divisible by k
Description: Finds the longest subsequence where the sum is divisible by an integer k.
Input: INPDIVSEQ.TXT containing the sequence size and integer k.
Output: OUTDIVSEQ.TXT with the subsequence length, element indices, and total sum.
Algorithm: Dynamic programming.

## Exercise 3: Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) with Kruskal’s Algorithm
Description: Constructs a minimal spanning tree of an undirected, connected graph using Kruskal’s algorithm.
Input: INPARBGRAPH.TXT containing the number of vertices and edges in the graph.
Output: OUTARBGRAPH.TXT with the edges of the minimal spanning tree.
Algorithm: Kruskal.
